        <!-- Here's how the game works:
 
        * There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.
     
        * The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.
     
        * When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 
     
          * Your game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
          * When they do click one, update the player's score counter.
     
        * The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.
     
        * The player loses if their score goes above the random number.
     
        * The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.
     
          * When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.
     
        * The app should show the number of games the player wins and loses. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game.
     
     ##### Option 1 Game design notes
     
     * The random number shown at the start of the game should be between 19 - 120.
     
     * Each crystal should have a random hidden value between 1 - 12. -->
