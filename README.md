In this javascript assignment, I intend to build a game that a player gets to click on four crystals with unknown values in order for their sum total to equal a computer-generatd number at the start of the game. Player loses the game once the sum total value of crystals go above the computer number, at which point the game restarts with a new number. Each win/loss is registered until game is reset by refreshing page of closing out browser tab.
